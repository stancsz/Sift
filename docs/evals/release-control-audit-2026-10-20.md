# Sift release-control audit — 2026-10-20

Read-only audit of current repository and public package state after PR #20 merged. No settings were changed and no release or PyPI upload was attempted.

## Findings

| Control | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Publish workflow entry | **Verified** | [`publish.yml`](../../.github/workflows/publish.yml) is `workflow_dispatch` only and both build and publish jobs run only when `github.ref == refs/heads/main`. The selected tag must be stable `vX.Y.Z` and match the package version. |
| PyPI deployment branch | **Verified, with bypass caveat** | GitHub's `pypi` environment has a custom deployment branch policy listing `main`: [environment](https://api.github.com/repos/stancsz/sift/environments/pypi), [allowed branches](https://api.github.com/repos/stancsz/sift/environments/pypi/deployment-branch-policies). Environment metadata reports `can_admins_bypass: true`. |
| Required deployment reviewer | **Configured, not independent** | The `pypi` environment lists `stancsz` as its sole required reviewer and `prevent_self_review: false`; the configured reviewer can approve their own deployment. The environment review is therefore not an independent approval gate. |
| Stable tag ruleset | **Active, owner-bypassable** | [Repository ruleset 25458147](https://api.github.com/repos/stancsz/sift/rulesets/25458147) matches `refs/tags/v*` and restricts creation, update, and deletion. `stancsz` is a bypass actor with mode `always`, so the rule does not prevent the owner from bypassing it. |
| `main` branch protection | **Not configured** | `GET /repos/stancsz/sift/branches/main/protection` returned HTTP 404 (“Branch not protected”). The PyPI environment separately limits deployments to `main`, but PR review/required-check protection for `main` is not established by that environment rule. |
| PyPI project and pending publisher | **Unverified** | `https://pypi.org/pypi/sift-context/json` returned HTTP 404. This shows no public project record at audit time, but the public endpoint does not expose whether the owner has configured a pending Trusted Publisher. Verify in the authenticated PyPI account before any release. |

## Release disposition

Do not describe the release controls as fully verified or independently gated. Before a stable publish, the owner should verify pending-publisher configuration in PyPI, decide whether an independent reviewer can be configured (and enable self-review prevention if so), and decide whether to add branch protection or required PR checks on `main`. Preserve the documented owner bypass behavior for tag/environment rules only if that is an intentional recovery path. Re-run this audit after any settings change and before the first publish.

This audit is configuration evidence only. It does not establish package correctness, quality parity, user adoption, or approval to publish.
